# Main features of A7JS

CLI - Development server and boilerplate for new projects and components

Router - Fully working frontend routing system.

Component Design - helps you with splitting your code into components.

# Setup

Install it

```shell
npm i a7js -g

```

Cd into the new project

```shell
cd [newproject]

# Motivation

Most of the commonly used libraries / frameworks are really large and also packs in features that most of the users will never use.

a7JS focuses on the stuff that would be really hard to make from scratch.

If there is something that you feel like we could add make an feature request. We aprove those which would benefit us all!

And it has 0 dependencies on the code that runs at the front end and also it is fully es5.

The dependencies that it has are for the cli and other useful tools.
