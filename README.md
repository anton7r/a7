ðŸ”¥ A lot of power in a small package.

âœ… Frontend framework only 2,6kb gzipped and minified.

# Motivation

Most of the commonly used libraries / frameworks are really large and also packs in features that most of the users will never use.

And it has 0 dependencies on the code that runs at the front end and also it is fully es5.

The dependencies that it has are for the cli and other useful tools.
