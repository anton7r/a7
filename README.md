# a7JS
a7 is a Javascript Framework which makes SPA's really easy to make

## Setup
Download the latest release or the version which you like the most and include it inside your web project.

Then insert a <script> at the end of the body to link to a7.js for development stage because bugs are then much easier to track
when going to production replace the link to a7.js to a7.min.js for maximum performance for your websites users.

also add a new .js file you can name it whatever you want but you should maybe name it like app.js or a7app.js....

In the new script...
