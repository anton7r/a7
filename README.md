# What are the features?

CLI - Development server and boilerplate for new projects and components
Router - Fully working

# Setup

Install it:

```shell
npm i a7js -g
```

Start a new project:

```shell
a7 newproject [projectname]
```

Run development server

```shell
a7 devserver
```

# Motivation

Most of the commonly used libraries / frameworks are really large and also packs in features that most of the users will never use.

a7JS focuses on the stuff that would be really hard to make from scratch.

And it has 0 dependencies on the code that runs at the front end and also it is fully es5.

The dependencies that it has are for the cli and other useful tools.
