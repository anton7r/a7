# a7JS
a7 is a Javascript Framework which makes SPA's really easy to make

also it Works in IE 11

## Setup
Download or clone it then launch cli installer.bat as adminstator rights so that it can install the cli.

The cli is still in development.

Once you have the cli installed then you can run a7 help in the terminal.

now you can start a new project by making a dir for your new project and `cd` into it and then run `a7 newproject` which will copy a7 into the current folder and it will give you a solid starting point with all the boiler plate.

If you ever need to update a7JS in your projects just run `a7 init` to update the scripts.
