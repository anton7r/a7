# Main features of A7JS

CLI - Development server and boilerplate for new projects, components

Router - Fully working frontend routing system.

Modular Design - split parts of your app into components!

# Setup

Install it

```shell
npm i a7js -g
```

Start a new project

```shell
a7 newproject [projectname]
```

Cd into the new project

```shell
cd [newproject]
```

Run development server

```shell
a7 devserver
```

# Motivation

Most of the commonly used libraries / frameworks are really large and also packs in features that most of the users will never use.

a7JS focuses on the stuff that would be really hard to make from scratch.

If there is something that you feel like we could add make an feature request. We aprove those which would benefit us all!

And it has 0 dependencies on the code that runs at the front end and also it is fully es5.

The dependencies that it has are for the cli and other useful tools.

## 4.0.0-beta.10

Fixed a bug in the development server.

Added a feature that adds component automatically to your main javascript file when creating it using the `a7 newcomponent ...` command.

## Before 4.0.0

The state of A7JS back then was just small blob compared to the state of it right now.
The only thing that has stayed from Version 1 is the router and how it works, since then it has been improved on.

Writing apps in A7JS version 3 was also quite painful since you were writinh pretty much the code that your application is now adays compiled to.

While version 3 wasn't the best, it enabled us to make it even better with version 4.
Also version 3 was pretty much a complete rewrite of the framework.

Around version 2 & version 1 it was a pain to make an application using A7JS.
